    "\n",
    "Logging is a way to store information about your script and track events that occur. When writing any complex script in Python, logging is essential for debugging software as you develop it. Without logging, finding the source of a problem in your code may be extremely time consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a built-in library, logging, for this purpose. It is simple to create a “logger” to log messages or information that you would like to see.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logging system in Python operates under a hierarchical namespace and different levels of severity. The Python script can create a logger under a namespace, and every time a message is logged, the script must specify its severity. The logged message can go to different places depending on the handler we set up for the namespace. The most common handler is to simply print on the screen, like the ubiquitous print() function. When we start the program, we may register a new handler and set up the level of severity to which the handler will react.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 5 different logging levels that indicate the severity of the logs, shown in increasing severity:\n",
    "<pre>\n",

    "\n",
    "Logging levels are the labels added to the log entries for the purpose of searching, filtering, and classifying log entries. This helps to manage the granularity of information. When log levels are set using the standard logging library, only events of that level or higher will be recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to always include a timestamp for each log entry. Knowing an event occurred without knowing when is not much better than not knowing about the event at all. This information is useful for troubleshooting, as well as for better insights for analytical uses.\n",

    "\n",
    "Formatter objects have the following attributes and methods. They are responsible for converting a LogRecord to (usually) a string which can be interpreted by either a human or an external system. The base Formatter allows a formatting string to be specified. If none is supplied, the default value of '%(message)s' is used, which just includes the message in the logging call. To have additional items of information in the formatted output (such as a timestamp), keep reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Formatter can be initialized with a format string which makes use of knowledge of the LogRecord attributes - such as the default value mentioned above making use of the fact that the user’s message and arguments are pre-formatted into a LogRecord’s message attribute. This format string contains standard Python %-style mapping keys. See section printf-style String Formatting for more information on string formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b style=\"color:green;\">format(record)</b>\n",
    "The record’s attribute dictionary is used as the operand to a string formatting operation. Returns the resulting string. Before formatting the dictionary, a couple of preparatory steps are carried out. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b style=\"color:green;\">formatTime(record, datefmt=None)</b>\n",
    "This method should be called from format() by a formatter which wants to make use of a formatted time. This method can be overridden in formatters to provide for any specific requirement, but the basic behavior is as follows: if datefmt (a string) is specified, it is used with time.strftime() to format the creation time of the record. Otherwise, the format ‘%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S,uuu’ is used, where the uuu part is a millisecond value and the other letters are as per the time.strftime() documentation. An example time in this format is 2003-01-23 00:29:50,411. The resulting string is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b style=\"color:green;\">formatException(exc_info)</b>\n",
    "Formats the specified exception information (a standard exception tuple as returned by sys.exc_info()) as a string. This default implementation just uses traceback.print_exception(). The resulting string is returned.\n",

    "<b style=\"color:green;\">formatStack(stack_info)</b>\n",
    "Formats the specified stack information (a string as returned by traceback.print_stack(), but with the last newline removed) as a string. This default implementation just returns the input value.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b style=\"color:green;\">formatHeader(records)</b>\n",
    "Return a header for a list of records. The base implementation just returns the empty string. You will need to override this method if you want specific behaviour, e.g. to show the count of records, a title or a separator line.\n",

    "<pre>\n",
    "The logging module in Python is a ready-to-use and powerful module that is designed to meet the needs of beginners as well as enterprise teams. It is used by most of the third-party Python libraries, so you can integrate your log messages with the ones from those libraries to produce a homogeneous log for your application.\n",

    "import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "With the logging module imported, you can use something called a “logger” to log messages that you want to see. By default, there are 5 standard levels indicating the severity of events.

    "Logging is a popular solution for tracking events in a code or debugging. To define basic logging needs, several lines of code are needed. Including additional logging information is not easy.
